q:what is meaning of sefa?
	a:sefa is abbreviation of [Script dErived From jAva]

the rule of productions:
note : [] is repeated zero or once  ,{} is repeated more than zero or equals zero;

	primary		:	( "("expr")" | NUMBER	| IDENTIFIER | STRING | closure){postfix}    
	factor		:	"-"primary	| primary
	expr		:	factor	{OP factor}
	block		:	"{" [statement] {(";"|EOL) [statement]} "}"
	statement	:	"if" expr block ["else" block]
					| "while" expr block
					|	expr
	args		: expr {"," expr}
	param		: IDENTIFIER
	params		: param {"," param}
	param_list	: "(" [params] ")"
	postfix		: "." IDENTIFIER | "(" [args] ")"
	member		: def | expr
	closure		:	"closure" param_list block      
	class_body	: "{" [member] {(";" | EOL) [member] } "}"
	function	: "def" IDENTIFIER param_list block
	defclass	: "class" IDENTIFIER ["extends" IDENTIFER] class_body
	program		:	[defclass | function | statement]	(";"|EOL) ;
	
	
	
when I designed this interpreter ,
I made some compromises for simplifing the process of coding.
For example , the production of primary  that may be incorrect will product a wrong sentence.

with the further development of this project , the productions is somewhat unreasonable.
I hate this style of production , but I have no ideas under that condition.

NOTE:Don't forget to add the limitation of block of function.!!!
